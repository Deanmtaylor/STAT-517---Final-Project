# STAT-517---Final-Project

West Nile Virus (WNV) is spread throughout the world from a mosquito vector, where the virus replicates and increases in numbers, to the human host, where it can no longer spread. In the United States WNV is spread by the mosquito __Culex pippens__ and __Culex quinquefasciatus__, both of which have large distributions in most regions of the U.S. Our strongest defense against the transmission of WNV is spraying insectcides, which effectively kill adult mosquitoes. 

However, in recent years mosquito resistance to insecticides is rapidly increasing throughout the world, primarily due to over spraying. one way to reduce resistance is to spray less frequently in targeted areas and times. If we were able to predict the outbreak of WNV in regions than we may be able to target when we should spray, essentially reducing the chance of insecticide resistance spreading, and the spread of the virus. 

I plan to use a dataset containing thousands of mosquitoes collections from the city of chicago, with longitude and latitude location of collection, the genus and species, and if the mosquiote contained WNV mRNA. With this data we can visualize the prevelance of virus by time of year, location, temperature, rainfall and many other factors.

Hopefully by using this dataset we can predict outbreaks of WNV and preemptively spray at specific times to reduce the spread of WNV.
