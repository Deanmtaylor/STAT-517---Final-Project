# STAT-517---Final-Project

West Nile Virus (WNV) is spread throughout the world from the mosquito vector, where the virus replicates and increases in numbers, to the human host. In the United States WNV is spread by the mosquito Culex pippens and Culex quinquefasciatus, both of which have large distributions in most regions of the U.S. Our strongest defense against the transmission of WNV the spraying of insectcides, which effectively kill adult mosquitoes, especially the female mosquito who is the only one that bites humans for blood. 

However, in recent years mosquito resistance to insecticides is rapidly increasing throughout the world, primarily due to over spraying. one way to reduce this resistance, other than development of new compunds, is to spray less frequently, but this would lead to more mosquitoes present. If we were able to predict the outbreak of WNV in regions than we may be able to target when we should spray, essentially reducing the chance of insecticide resistance spreading, and the spread of the virus. 

I plan to use a dataset containing thousands of mosquitoes collections from the city of chicago, with longitude and latitude location of collection, the genus and species, and if the mosquiote contained virus mRNA. With this data we can visualize the prevelance of virus by years, and even break it down to the time of year, winter vs. summer. The dataset also contains weahter information for each collection date, rain, temperature, sunshine vs clouds, along with many other variables. 

Hopefully by using this dataset we can predict outbreaks of WNV and preemptively spray at specific times to reduce the spread of WNV.
